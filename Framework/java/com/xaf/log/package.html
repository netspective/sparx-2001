This package extends log4j by adding extra logging attributes useful in
distributed application server environments.  Specifically, it adds
the following text information to each logging event.
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>host (h)</b> - the machine from which the message was logged
<li><b>server (s)</b> - the server process from which the message was logged
<li><b>component (b)</b> - the component from which the message was logged
<li><b>version (v)</b> - a version string for the code from which the
   message was logged
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
Using this package in your programs differs little from using
{@link org.apache.log4j.Category}.  In this initial version,
only property file initialization is supported.

<h3>Automatic Configuration</h3>
The following properties serve to configure the {@link
com.xaf.log.AppServerCategoryFactory}.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Property<th>Description
<tr><td><code><b>log4j.categoryFactory</b></code>
	<td>The {@link org.apache.log4j.spi.CategoryFactory}
	implementation to use.
<tr><td><code><b>log4j.factory.server</b></code>
	<td>The value assigned to the server attribute.
<tr><td><code><b>log4j.factory.component</b></code>
	<td>The value assigned to the component attribute.
<tr><td><code><b>log4j.factory.version</b></code>
	<td>The value assigned to the version attribute.
<tr><td><code><b>log4j.factory.messageBundle</b></code>
	<td>The name of bundle file to populate the message
	<code>ResourceBundle</code>.  Because the
	<code>ResourceBundle.getBundle</code> method is used to load
	the message file, the <code>".properties"</code> extension
	should <b>not</b> be included as part of this property.
</table>
<p>
A sample configuration might look like this.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td><pre>
log4j.categoryFactory=com.xaf.log.AppServerCategoryFactory
log4j.factory.server=TestServer
log4j.factory.component=TestComponent
log4j.factory.version=SomeVersion
log4j.factory.messageBundle=app_messages

log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=com.xaf.log.AppServerPatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=[%h:%s:%b:%v] %m%n
</pre></table>
<p>
<!--
There is <b>no</b> need to change your source code to go from using
<code>Category</code> to <code>AppServerCategory</code> if you are
using property files to configure your logging infrastructure.
Simply specifying the <code>AppServerCategoryFactory</code>
as the {@link org.apache.log4j.spi.CategoryFactory} implementation
does the trick.  It installs the factory
as the default factory for the hierarchy so that
{@link org.apache.log4j.Category#getInstance(String)} always returns
the proper <code>Category</code> subclass.
  -->
The only change needed to your source file is to invoke the {@link
com.xaf.log.AppServerCategory#getInstance(String)}
instead of the usual {@link org.apache.log4j.Category#getInstance(String)}
to acquire an implementation of <code>Category</code>.

<h3>Manual Configuration</h3>
You can manually invoke the configuration much like the static
initializer would have.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td><pre>
import org.apache.log4j.Category;
import org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator;
import com.xaf.log.AppServerCategory;
...
PropertyConfigurator.configure("test.properties");
Category cat = AppServerCategory.getInstance("some.cat");
...
cat.info("This is an INFO statement.");
</pre> </table>
<p>
<h3>Very Manual Configuration</h3>
If you want complete control over the configuration process, you
can leave <code>PropertyConfigurator</code> out of it all
together.  This could be useful if you want only some of your
categories to be <code>AppServerCategory</code> instances.
<p>
Simply create an <code>AppServerCategoryFactory</code> instance.
The constructor automatically installs the new instance as the
default factory for future calls to {@link
com.xaf.log.AppServerCategory#getInstance(String)}.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td><pre>
import org.apache.log4j.Category;
import com.xaf.log.AppServerCategoryFactory;
import com.xaf.log.AppServerCategory;
...
org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator.configure();
new AppServerCategoryFactory("MyServer", null, null);
...
Category cat = AppServerCategory.getInstance("my.category");
cat.info("Entry");
</pre> </table>
<p>
<h4>A Note on Configurators</h4>
Using the <i>very manual</i> approach to configure
<code>AppServerCategory</code> with
<code>PropertyConfigurator</code> or <code>DOMConfigurator</code>
requires a note of caution.  Since the <i>very manual</i> method
does not provide the <code>log4j.categoryFactory</code> property,
these configurators do not know that <code>Category</code> has
been subclassed.  Upon
constructing a configuration from a set of properties, it will
construct <code>Category</code> instances rather than instances
of the desired subclass.  One way to around this is decribed
below.
<p>
By instanciating any anticipated <code>AppServerCategory</code>
instances before calling a configurator, the configurator will
use the instances you create rather than trying to (incorrectly)
create its own.  The consequence is that you can
not always predict which categories will be created.  Their
dynamic nature is the reason for externalizing their configuration
in the first place.  This drawback is limited to category names
explicitly defined in the configuration.
<p>
<h2>Remote Usage</h2>
Including attributes such as hostname and server are only relevant
if the logging entries somehow end up on other hosts or mixed with
those of other servers.  Remote logging in a distributed application
environment allows the logging of various remote components to be
collected together in a single location.  The basic building blocks
for remote usage are the <code>SimpleSocketServer</code> used in
conjunction with the <code>SocketAppender</code>.
<p>
The configuration of <code>SimpleSocketServer</code> receiving
serialized <code>AppServerLoggingEvent</code> classes is much the
same as with the standard <code>LoggingEvent</code> class.  The main
difference to keep in mind is that the layout implementation should be
<code>com.xaf.log.AppServerPatternLayout</code>.
This will allow for the interpretation of %h, %s, %b and %v symbols.
<p>
<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
This package may be used as a template for
specifying your own collection of attributes or extended to include
additional attributes.  A
<a href="../../../../../../deepExtension.html">log4j extension manual</a>
accompanies this distribution that will take you step by step through the
extension process.
