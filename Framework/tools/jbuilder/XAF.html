<STRONG>Description:  </STRONG><BR>

<HR>
XAF is a pure Java, Servlet, XML, XSLT, and JSP-based RAD tool for building highly
interactive and dynamic web applications. The objective of XAF is to allow
enterprises to build and deploy more web applications using fewer programmers,
less time, with higher-quality, and better documentation than using Java and
Servlet engines alone. Some of our customers have been able to cut their
development budgets in half by reducing the number or qualifications of their
programmers. This is because XAF allows junior and mid-level Java developers
to be as or more effective than senior and more experienced developers.
<p>
Unlike web <i>site</i> development tools which focus more on presentation and
less on business logic, XAF helps construct powerful data aggregation and
interactive forms-based data-driven web <i>applications</i>.
<p>
According to Michael Blechar, VP Internet & eBusiness Technologies, GartnerGroup:<br>
"By 2003 at least 70% of the total number of new applications will be built primarily
from 'building blocks' such as software components and application frameworks,
increasing both products speed to market and enterprises ability to cope with change
The future of application development lies with an open architecture that facilitates
component choice, assembly and integration. IS organizations must have a strategy
for the inevitable shift to component-based development. Components in the
form of design patterns, application frameworks and business and technical
components can significantly increase quality and productivity in development
through reuse. Reuse, in turn, can significantly lower cost and shorten
time-to-market."
<p>
XAF was designed and it's customers can attest to the fact that it is a perfect
environment to realize the benefits of an application framework to reduce cost
and shorten development cycles through re-use.

<h2>Significant Features</h2>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan=2><b>Data Entry, UI, and Forms Management</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">XML-based Web Dialogs</font></td>
		<td>
		XAF calls all forms "Dialogs" and dialogs are can be defined completely in XML.
		This includes labels, captions, validation logic, conditional displays,
		and other advanced UI features. By keeping the entire definition in XML,
		non-programmers or junior engineers can create forms and more experienced
		developers can attach business logic.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Data Persistance</font></td>
		<td>
		As a user enters data, values persist through pages. This is especially
		useful for HTTP stateless programming where reporting errors requires
		pages to be redrawn. <i>Data Persistance</i> allows developers to refresh
		pages and have data automatically filled into controls.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Server-side Data Binding to HTML controls</font></td>
		<td>
		XAF allows almost any SQL or other data binding to any list controls in
		HTML or DHTML. This allows, for instance a query to be run and automatically
		create a list box, radio buttons, check boxes, and multi-select list boxes.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Automatic Validation</font></td>
		<td>
		XAF provides detailed client- and server-side validation logic for text,
		date, numeric, and other user-defined fields. All fields in XAF are object-
		oriented and know how to draw themselves onto HTML and DHTML browsers.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Skins and unlimited HTML and DHTML controls</font></td>
		<td>
		XAF separates presentation from forms design and logic by automatically
		creating all HTML and DHTML in user-defined "skin" objects. The skins
		perform all drawing operations while the forms objects manage all of the
		fields and validation. One immediate benefit of skins is the ability to
		design and describe a dialog once and exectute it on mobile, small form-
		factors (handhelds), notebooks, and desktops.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Form Objects</font></td>
		<td>
		Once defined in either XML or Java, each form becomes a Dialog <i>Object</i>
		that persists throughout each servlet request. This design significantly
		improves performance because form construction is required only once during
		the execution of the application.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Transaction Integrity</font></td>
		<td>
		All XAF dialogs have unique identifiers at both development and run-time.
		Features are provided to prevent duplicate data entry through the use of
		Dialog Transactions (preventing users from hitting the "back" button and
		re-running an older transaction).
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan=2><b>SQL and Data Management</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">SQL Statement Pooling</font></td>
		<td>
		To encourage reusability and encapsulation and reduce the amount of time
		spent creating "data beans", XAF allows all SQL statements and
		dynamic parameters used in a project to be specified in one or more
		SQL files. Once defined, a single or multiple SQL statements may be used
		in reports, dialogs (forms), Servlets, or JSP-pages. In many cases, SQL
		statement pooling completely replaces simple data-serving beans since
		data objects are automatically created for all SQL statements.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Data Aggregation</font></td>
		<td>
		Data can be easily aggregated from multiple data sources because each
		SQL statement in the statement pool can be specified (either in XML or
		JSP) to come from a variety of pre-defined or dynamic data sources.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">SQL DML Generation</font></td>
		<td>
		JSP custom tags and java classes are provided to automatically create
		SQL insert/update/remove DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands. By
		providing simple name/value pairs of data, XAF can automatically generate
		complex DML statements.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">SQL Select Generation</font></td>
		<td>
		A powerful XML-based tool called <i>Query Definitions</i> allows developers
		to define tables, columns, joins, sort orders, and other important data
		through the use of Meta Information about data relationships. Once a
		a developer creates a query definition, XAF allows end-users to use simple
		HTML-based forms to automatically generate SQL accurate and performance-tuned
		statements to create paged reports or export data to external sources.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Data Caching</font></td>
		<td>
		XAF allows SQL statements and other data sources to be cached with
		configurable time-outs. This is useful for seldom- or slowly-changing
		data that should not be retrieved from a database for each call.
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan=2><b>Report Writing and Data Presentation</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">XML-based Report Definitions</font></td>
		<td>
		XAF reports are defined completely in XML. This includes headings, banners,
		column types, calculations, grouping, sort order, etc. By keeping the entire
		definition in XML, 	non-programmers or junior engineers can create report
		definitions and more experienced developers can attach business logic.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Multiple Source Reports</font></td>
		<td>
		The data for reports can come from a single or multiple SQL data source,
		object arrays, or virtually and dynamic data source. A single XML-based
		report definition can server a variety of
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Skins for Multiple Output Destinations</font></td>
		<td>
		XAF uses special skins for automatically presenting reports in suitable
		formats; for instance, XAF reports can be formatted for HTML, PDF, ASCII,
		or any other user-defined format by creating appropriate skins. The same
		report definition will be able to support access on mobile devices, hand-held
		PDAs, notebooks, and desktops.

	<tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan=2><b>Schema Objects and DDL Generation</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">XML-based Schema Creation</font></td>
		<td>
		Create entire relational database schemas (tables, columns, data dictionaries, etc) in
		XML. Describing complete schemas in XML prevents database-specific data
		definitions and allows greater database vendor independence.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Object-based Relational Tables</font></td>
		<td>
		Allows object-oriented concepts to be applied to traditional, non object-
		oriented databases like MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. All the object
		definitions are provided in XML but when the relational data definition
		is created, they become portable table/column definitions. Data type
		inheritance and table inheritance is supported in all databases
		like MySQL, Access, Oracle, SQL Server, and FoxPro (through JDBC).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">DDL Generation</font></td>
		<td>
		All tables and columns defined in XML can be easily "converted" to
		vendor-specific SQL DDL (data definition language). All create table,
		alter table, constraint, foreign-key, and index commands are supported
		and automatically generated for even complex relationships.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Schema Objects</font></td>
		<td>
		When the XAF Schema Objects features are used, the application has full
		access to cached schema information about all tables, columns, descriptions,
		relationships, and other features. This allows schema access for automated forms
		building, report building, and tighter integration with data structures when
		appropriate.

	<tr>
		<td colspan=2><b>Application Components Explorer (ACE)</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Automatic Implementation Documentation</font></td>
		<td>
		Instead of having to create functional specifications and other implementation
		documentation manually, XAF provides the ACE to automatically document
		(using the XML definitions and XSLT stylesheets) all the forms (web
		dialogs), sql statements, schema objects, and other programming artifacts
		in a centralized browser-based interface. Developers concentrate on application
		creation while XAF automatically documents their work. Managers can use
		this documention in a real-time basis to track programmer work and productivity.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Interactive Testing</font></td>
		<td>
		While developers are working on forms and SQL statements, ACE automatically
		provides browser-based testing of the forms and statements. No servlets,
		or JSPs need to be written for basic testing of forms, validations, and
		SQL statements. Once initial testing is completed and requirements are
		solidified, then the forms and statements can be aggregated to create
		interactive applications. End users can use the interative testing tools
		to see code as it is being developed (supporting eXtreme Programming concepts).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Centralized Project Documentation</font></td>
		<td>
		ACE provides a centralized location for all project documentation for any
		application. Instead of storing application code and programmer documentation
		separately, ACE brings tag documentation, javadocs, MS Office documents,
		and other project documents into a single easily-accessible place. Managers
		will no longer need to hunt for documents.

		<td colspan=2><b>Personalization, Security, and Access Control</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Personalization</font></td>
		<td>
		All XAF applications support personalization features that allow applications
		to respond differently to differnent users based on location, user type,
		or user names.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign=top>
		<td><font color="green">Access Control Lists (ACLs)</font></td>
		<td>
		Centralized ACLs allow developers to restrict access to forms, reports,
		pages, and other resources based on user names, types, location, roles,
		capabilities, or other permissions.
