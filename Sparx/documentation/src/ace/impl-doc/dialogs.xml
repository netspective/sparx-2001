					Each dialog may be further analyzed by reviewing a user-

					Each dialog may be unit tested inside ACE to ensure that
					user requirements are being met and allowing analysts or end users
					to start reviewing a running application quickly and without
					programmers writing test harnesses. As soon as the XML is completed,
					the test harness is automatically created and may be executed by
					anyone with access to ACE.
