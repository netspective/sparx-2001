	Almost all components of a SQL statement are automatically captured and documented
	within ACE. This includes a list of all the SQL statements used througout the
	application, the parameters they require, and any views that may be attached to
	them.

					All of the SQL statements that are externalized in XML files appear
					in a single ACE page. Programmers and manager can use this view
					to review all the SQL statements that are used in an application.
					In addition to the actual SQL statements, performance metrics accompany
					each SQL statement indicating the number of times each statement
					is execute and the average/maximum time (in milliseconds) it took to
					execute the statement.

					Each SQL statement may be unit tested inside ACE to ensure that
					user requirements are being met. As soon as the XML is completed,
					the test harness is automatically created and may be executed by
					anyone with access to ACE. The statement, along with any reports/views
					can be tested without creating any additional code.
