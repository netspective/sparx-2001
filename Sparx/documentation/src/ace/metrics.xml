	As developers create forms, SQL statements, query definitions, JSP, servlets, and other
	code, ACE automatically maintains basic application metrics. Metrics are an important
	part of every sophisticated software development process and Sparx can not only capture
	the metrics but store them in XML files so that they can be analyzed over time.
