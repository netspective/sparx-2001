		ACE provides a centralized location for all project documentation for any
		application. Instead of storing application code and programmer
		documentation separately, ACE brings tag documentation, javadocs, MS
		Office documents, and other project documents into a single easilyaccessible
		place. Managers will no longer need to hunt for documents.
