		While developers are working on forms and SQL statements, ACE
		automatically provides browser-based testing of the forms and
		statements. No servlets, or JSPs need to be written for basic testing of
		forms, validations, and SQL statements. Once initial testing is completed
		and requirements are solidified, then the forms and statements can be
		aggregated to create interactive applications. End users can use the
		interactive testing tools to see code as it is being developed (supporting
		eXtreme Programming concepts).
