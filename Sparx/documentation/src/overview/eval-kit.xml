        The full Sparx Application Platform Release 2.0 can be <a href="http://www.netspective.com/web-netspective/support/downloads.html">downloaded</a>
        for a free 30-day evaluation period.
        Although Sparx runs on both Unix based and Windows PC machines, the Developer Kit for evaluation is only for
        Windows at this time. A Unix based evaluation will be posted soon.
        <p/>
        Please <link page="overview/requirements">review the requirements</link> first, make sure you have a <a href="http://java.sun.com">JDK</a> installed,
        then click <a href="http://www.netspective.com/web-netspective/support/downloads.html">here</a> to download and
        run the evaluation kit.
        <p/>
        The kit includes and automatically installs:
        <ul>
            <li>the Sparx Application Platform software</li>
            <li>sample applications</li>
            <li>an application server (a free developer version of <a href="http://www.caucho.com" target="www.caucho.com">Resin</a>)</li>
            <li>a pure Java database with JDBC driver (Hypersonic SQL)</li>

        </ul>

    <section heading="Database Requirements">
        Our Developer Kit for evaluation is bundled with several sample applications. The two simpler sample applications,
        called <i>hello</i> and <i>library</i>, can be run using the bundled (free) Hypersonic SQL Java database.
        <p/>
        One of the larger samples is Cura, a web based project management application for demonstration purposes. If you
        plan to evaluate Cura on your own servers, you will need to install Oracle (version 8 or newer) on a server
        and make it available for access by the server that will have the Sparx Developer Kit installed. You can choose
        to install Oracle on the same server as the Sparx Developer Kit provided it has the resources to handle both an
        application server and a database server.
