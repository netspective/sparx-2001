        The utility of any application framework can be discovered three ways. The first is introductory material that
        explains what the framework does. The second is detailed API documentation and usage patterns. The third, and
        perhaps the most important, is by looking at sample applications and actual code. This page describes the
        many sample applications provided with the <link page="overview/eval-kit">Sparx Evaluation Kit</link>,
        all of which are also available online.
