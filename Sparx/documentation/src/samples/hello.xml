        The <i>Hello World</i> example is a classic in nearly all texts dealing with programming.  It is the simplest
        way to demonstrate the syntax of the language, how to compile a program written in the language and how to run
        the resulting binary.  Sparx is no different.  Our first example is the Hello World example with a slight twist.
        Whereas this example shows the simplicity of Sparx, it shall also serve as a stepping stone to a more complex
        example that will better illustrate the power of Sparx. The output of most Hello World programs is a simple
        output to the screen of the phrase "Hello, World". The Sparx version, however, has a more interactive version
        of this example: it gets some information about you and then give you a Hello World greeting tailored to the
        information you provide.
