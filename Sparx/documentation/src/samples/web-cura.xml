        <i>Cura</i> is a latin words that means <i>to manage</i>/. From a functionality point of a view, Cura is a
        project management application. It allows management of individual people, projects and clients. From the utility
        standpoint, however, Cura is an exceptional example application
        that demonstrates a large number of Sparx development Best Practices.  It also demonstrates alternative
        development styles that serve two purposes. In short, Cura is a very usable full-blown application that shows
        what a few days of Sparx development can accomplish.
