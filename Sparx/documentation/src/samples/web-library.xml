        The <i>Library</i> is a small application meant to be used for a personal library of books. It allows you to
        track the books you have and add more books to your collection or edit information stored about existing books.
        It also allows you to search your collection for a particular book based on your own custom search criteria.
        The overall functionality of the application is limited but complete.  As such it demonstrates a few of the main
        types of data manipulation that developers need to take care of in every application.  In the end the goal is
        to show you just how much power can be wielded with just a few lines of XML and Java code when armed with the
        strength of Sparx.
