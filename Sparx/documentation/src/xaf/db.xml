		The XAF provides powerful database connection and aggregation services. Starting with a
		simple interface to one or more database connection	and pooling engines and including
		such features as dynamic data source definitions and selection, the database connectivity
		support sets the stage for both static and dynamic SQL libraries and pooled/cached
		result sets.

		The method of specifying datasources is dependent upon the application server being used.
		XAF's Java class <link class="sparx.xif.db.context.BasicDatabaseContext"/> uses the JNDI provider to provide pooled database
		connections. For other application servers, XAF provides an interface called
		<link class="sparx.xif.db.DatabaseContext"/> which can be used to implement a new database connection system dependent
		upon the application server's preferred way of obtaining datasources. The way to register
		the application server specific database object is to set the property in <code>WEB-INF/conf/sparx.xml</code>:

		<p>
		<code>
		&lt;system-property name="com.netspective.sparx.xif.db.DatabaseContext.class" value="com.netspective.sparx.xif.db.context.BasicDatabaseContext"/>
		</code>
		</p>
