	<summary>
		Dialogs allow data to be auto-populated and auto-executed. This means that
		a single dialog can serve multiple purposes: for use as a front-end for a
		user to edit/enter data and for a back-end process to enter
		data through a scripted process and automatically execute the same dialog
		as if a user had entered the data manually.
