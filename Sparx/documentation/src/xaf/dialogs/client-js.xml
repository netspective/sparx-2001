	A sophisticated Javascript library accompanies the server-side validation
	functionality that is intrinsic to the XAF (including keypress filters for allowing only
	specific keys to be pressed in certain field types likes numeric and date). Using the client-side Javascript
	validation, features like required fields and conditionally displayed fields
	become trivial to implement and test. In addition to the basic JavaScript object
	model, programmers can insert (extend) or replace JavaScript feature with their own
	custom functionality. External custom JavaScript files may also be included into any
	dialog or page.
