	XAF provides many built-in thin-client UI controls and the ability for
	programmers to subclass and further refine or replace the existing
	controls. Field type such as text, numeric, select (choices), boolean,
	date, time, and many others come with the base classes. All of the base
	classes already know how to validate themselves.
