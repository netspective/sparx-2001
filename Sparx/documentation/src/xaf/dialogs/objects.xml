		Once defined in either XML or Java, each form becomes a Dialog <i>Object</i>
		that persists throughout each servlet request. This design significantly
		improves performance because form construction is required only once during
		the execution of the application. Because every dialog ends up as a Java
		object it means that the XML can define the basic behavior that can later
		be extended by Java.
