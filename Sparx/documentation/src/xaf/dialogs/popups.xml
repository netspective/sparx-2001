	XAF Dialogs have the built-in capability to bind and display popup windows that can
	elicit extra information from an end-user and populate a field. This type of functionality
	becomes very useful when a combo box or list box is not appropriate for requesting data
	from a list of choices when the the list of choices is very long. For example, when asking
	for a patient ID from a medical database that might be large, a popup window can be implemented
	that allows for searching in the popup window and then when a selection is made it is filled
	into the calling window's control.
