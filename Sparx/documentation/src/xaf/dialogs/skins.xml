	<summary>
		XAF separates presentation from forms design and logic by automatically
		creating all HTML and DHTML in user-defined "skin" objects. The skins
		perform all drawing operations while the forms objects manage all of the
		fields and validation. One immediate benefit of skins is the ability to
		design and describe a dialog once and exectute it on mobile, small form-
		factors (handhelds), notebooks, and desktops.

	<section heading="Sample of the Same Dialog Rendering Using Different Skins">
		All aspects of the visual rendering of a Dialog (colors, fonts, layout, etc.) are controlled
		using Java-based skins. Skins can be either XSLT-based, pure Java, or any combination that
		is required by the programmer.
