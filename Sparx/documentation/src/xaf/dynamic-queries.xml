		A powerful XML-based tool called <i>Query Definitions</i> allows developers
		to define tables, columns, joins, sort orders, and other important data
		through the use of Meta Information about data relationships. Once a
		a developer creates a query definition, XAF allows end-users to use simple
		HTML-based forms to automatically generate SQL accurate and performance-tuned
		statements to create paged reports or export data to external sources.
