	Once all the rules (fields, joins, conditions, etc) are defined then SQL
	statements can be generated and cached at application startup. Instead of
	creating static SQL statements in code or even the SQL Libraries feature
	of XAF, programmers can create query definitions (rules) and let the XAF
	generate the SQL. This allows much better data abstraction because when
	the database columns, tables, or rules change only the query definition
	needs to be updated (as opposed to potentially dozens of SQL statements).
