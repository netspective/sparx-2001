	<summary>
		XAF reports are defined completely in XML. This includes headings, banners,
		column types, calculations, grouping, sort order, etc. By keeping the entire
		definition in XML, 	non-programmers or junior engineers can create report
		definitions and more experienced developers can attach business logic.
	</summary>

	<section heading="Multiple Source Reports">
		The data for reports can come from a single or multiple SQL data source,
		object arrays, or virtually and dynamic data source. A single XML-based
		report definition can serve a variety of needs.
	</section>

	<section heading="Skins for Multiple Output Destinations">
		XAF uses special skins for automatically presenting reports in suitable
		formats; for instance, XAF reports can be formatted for HTML, PDF, ASCII,
		or any other user-defined format by creating appropriate skins. The same
		report definition will be able to support access on mobile devices, hand-held
		PDAs, notebooks, and desktops.
