		XAF separates form/report presentation from form/report design and logic by
		automatically creating all HTML and DHTML in user-defined "skin" objects. The skins
		perform all drawing operations while the report/form objects manage all of the
		fields and validation. One immediate benefit of skins is the ability to
		design and describe a dialog once and exectute it on mobile, small form-
		factors (handhelds), notebooks, and desktops or to different formats like
		PDFs, comma-separated, and tab-delimited.
