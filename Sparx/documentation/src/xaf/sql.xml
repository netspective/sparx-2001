		To encourage reusability and encapsulation and reduce the amount of time
		spent creating "data beans", XAF allows all SQL statements and
		dynamic parameters used in a project to be specified in one or more
		SQL files. Once defined, a single or multiple SQL statements may be used
		in reports, dialogs (forms), Servlets, or JSP-pages. In many cases, SQL
		statement pooling completely replaces simple data-serving beans since
		data objects are automatically created for all SQL statements.
		Data can be easily aggregated from multiple data sources because each
		SQL statement in the statement pool can be specified (either in XML or
		JSP) to come from a variety of pre-defined or dynamic data sources.
