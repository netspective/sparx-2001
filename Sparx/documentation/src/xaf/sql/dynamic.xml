	In certain cases there are requirements that specify a SQL statement is
	generally the same except in certain circumstances. For these situations,
	the XAF allows for quasi-dynamic SQL statements that have the ability to
	do macro replacements inside the SQL as well as parameters. The SQL statement
	can have macros that are replaced each time the SQL is called and the parameters
	that may be passed in are dynamic (using single-value and list-value sources).
	The most common usage of this feature is to create an IN clause.
