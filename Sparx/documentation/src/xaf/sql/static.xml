	The most common usage of the SQL Libraries feature is to create a library of static
	SQL statements with parameters. Each SQL statement will be treated almost like stored
	procedures in databases. Although the SQL statement is static, the parameters that may
	be passed in are dynamic (using single-value and list-value sources).
