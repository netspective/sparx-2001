<body>
Provides the ability to separate the presentation of a form/report from the design and logic of it by allowing to create
the output HTML and DHTML in user-defined <i>skin</i> objects. These skins perform all drawing operations while the
report/form objects manage all of the fields and validation. An important benefit of skins is the ability to
design and describe a form once and exectute it on mobile, small form-factors (handhelds), notebooks, and
desktops or to different formats like PDFs, comma-separated, and tab-delimited.
