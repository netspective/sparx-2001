Provides functionality for executing database query and modification statements: this includes the complete specification
of SQL statements with dynamic parameters in a XML-based resource format, and execution of statement actions
in Java classes or JSP (using a supplied tag-lib). Data for the SQL statements can be easily aggregated from multiple
data sources because each SQL statement in the statement pool can be specified (either in XML or JSP) to come from a
variety of pre-defined or dynamic data sources.
