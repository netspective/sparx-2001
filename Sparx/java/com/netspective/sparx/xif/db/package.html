Provides database management functionality; this includes overall schema management and RDBMS DDL generation,
meta-data management, and connection pooling (perferably using JNDI, but not necessarily).

This package differs from the com.netspective.sparx.xaf.sql package in that it provides overall database management
functionality such as connection management and schema management whereas the sql package provides
for SQL statement pooling and SQL generation.
