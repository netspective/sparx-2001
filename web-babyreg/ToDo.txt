2. See if we could extend the select field to have "All" instead of "" as the first element or

3. See how we could avoid showing "null" for some values when deleting.
1. Change the hardcoded values of -1 and 0 to use value sources or config values.
5. Make it more attractive.
6. Write document

10. Security for the ADmin pages.
11. Look at the status-category foreing key problem on brand new gifts.
12. Asses if we really need to use DMLs or could we move to SQL stored in the statements.xml
