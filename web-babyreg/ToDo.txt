These are the things that are still left to do:

2. Refactor "Suggestion", "Tell me what you got" and "Gift Detail"
3. Security for the ADmin pages.
4. Change the hardcoded values of -1 and 0 to use value sources or config values.
6. Look at the status-category foreing key problem on brand new gifts.
8. Asses if we really need to use DMLs or could we move to SQL stored in the statements.xml
9. See how we could avoid showing "null" for some values when deleting.
10. See if we could extend the select field to have "All" instead of "" as the first element or
    simply have a value source that adds that at the begining of the List.
11. Take a closer look at the way the images are being done.  It could be improved.
12. Finish Filling the DB and change all the names
13. Make it more attractive.
14. Write document
15. Verify some extrange behavior with the "List ALl Items" dinamic query.  It has some weird paging after
    updating or deleting an item.
16. Take care of Cancel in the Gift Detail dialog
